# AN-AUTOMATED-SEARCH-ENGINE-BASED-CONTENT-CATEGORIZATION-OF-VIDEO-USING-CNN-AND-GAN
Search engines play a vital role in a wide array of applications because they assist
users to quickly discover relevant information. However, as data grows exponentially, existing
search engines do not have the ability to retrieve specific video results. To improve the user
experience in a video-centric environment, search engines should be more flexible at
retrieving relevant information more quickly by categorizing the media content. In
consideration of various categories connected to everyday human activities like swimming,
dancing, singing, laughing, sports, these fields can range from entertainment to surveillance
and a lot more that are highly searched. All of these requirements can be met by developing a
search application that uses Deep Learning techniques such as CNN (Convolutional Neural
Network) and GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks), which can be used to categorize video
content. As a result data from the predictions and time stamps of the search results for a
specific video is stored in the database, allowing us to train our model to be efficient and
effective. Furthermore, we deploy this model in real-time applications like gallery, which
allows users to search for video categories and the application suggests video clips relevant to
that category. From there, the model can be adapted to a variety of fields as well.
